## fold2Bloch/Utils

Utilities that help to generate a list of k points and plot the unfolded band structure

### fold.m

MATLAB code that generates a set of k-point on a desired path for unfolding. It produces files `case.klist_band` for WIEN2k and `KPOINTS` for VASP. One can naively think that a regular k-point list used for the band structure plot will also work for unfolding. NO. Here we need a list of k-points that _after_ unfolding will fall onto a desired path and cover it uniformly without gaps. Users are strongly encouraged to use this utility.

### ubs_dots.m

MATLAB code to plot the unfolded band structure as a bubble plot. This is the fastest way to visualize bands.

### ubs_bmp.m

Octave script to prepare a binary file `case.f2b.bin` for the “heat map” plotting style (similar to ARPES).

### f2b-band-structure.plt

Gnuplot script that takes the binary file `case.f2b.bin` generated by `ubs_bmp.m` and produces a publication-quality raster plot.
